# Project-Tracker
This is a vibe-coded mashup project I made in a few hours. I vibe coded 6 iterations, and then mashed up the best parts into one cohesive-ish html file.  It uses local storage to store all the data as it's written. It has customizable theme colors, an expandable network of nodes to track project phases with, and path-traced lighting that.

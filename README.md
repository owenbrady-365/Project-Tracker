# Project-Tracker
This is a vibe-coded mashup project I made in a few hours. I vibe coded 6 iterations, and then mashed up the best parts into one cohesive-ish html file.  It uses local storage to store all the data as it's written. It has customizable theme colors, an expandable network of nodes to track project phases with, and path-traced lighting using recursive ancestor checks to make sure the path doesn't have any breaks in it. 

The whole code was built with several instances of CodeGPT 5.2, and was created on january 16th, 2026
